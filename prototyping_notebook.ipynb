    "text = 'Amorphous oxide semiconductors (AOSs)—ternary or quaternary oxides of post‐transition metals such as In‐Sn‐O, Zn‐Sn‐O, or In‐Ga‐Zn‐O—have been known for a decade and have attracted a great deal of attention as they possess several technological advantages, including low‐temperature large‐area deposition, mechanical flexibility, smooth surfaces, and high carrier mobility that is an order of magnitude larger than that of amorphous silicon (a‐Si:H). Compared to their crystalline counterparts, the structure of AOSs is extremely sensitive to deposition conditions, stoichiometry, and composition, giving rise to a wide range of tunable optical and electrical properties. The large parameter space and the resulting complex deposition–structure–property relationships in AOSs make the currently available theoretical and experimental research data rather scattered and the design of new materials difficult. In this work, the key properties of several In‐based AOSs are studied as a function of cooling rates, oxygen stoichiometry, cation composition, or lattice strain. Based on a thorough comparison of the results of ab initio modeling, comprehensive structural analysis, accurate property calculations, and systematic experimental measurements, a four‐dimensional parameter space for AOSs is derived, serving as a solid foundation for property optimization in known AOSs and for design of next‐generation transparent amorphous semiconductors.'"

    "text2 = 'Self-organization is a property of dissipative nonlinear processes that are governed  by a global driving force and a local positive feedback  mechanism, which  createsregular geometric and/or temporal patterns, and decreases the entropy locally, in contrast torandom processes. Here we investigate for the first time a comprehensive number of self-organization processes that operate in planetary physics, solar physics, stellar physics,galactic physics, and cosmology. Self-organizing systems create spontaneous “order out of randomness”, during the evolution from an initially disordered system to an ordered quasi-stationary system, mostly by quasi-periodic limit-cycle dynamics, but also by harmonic (me-chanical or gyromagnetic) resonances. The global driving force can be due to gravity, elec-tromagnetic forces, mechanical forces (e.g., rotation or differential rotation), thermal pressure, or acceleration of nonthermal particles, while the positive feedback mechanism is often an instability, such as the magneto-rotational (Balbus-Hawley) instability, the convective(Rayleigh-Bénard) instability, turbulence, vortex attraction, magnetic reconnection, plasmacondensation, or a loss-cone instability. Physical models of astrophysical self-organizationprocesses require hydrodynamic, magneto-hydrodynamic (MHD), plasma, or N-body simu-lations. Analytical formulations of self-organizing systems generally involve coupled differential equations with limit-cycle solutions of the Lotka-Volterra or Hopf-bifurcation type.'"

       " 'A multipurpose interconnection layer based on poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythio-phene) doped with poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS), and d-sorbitol for monolithic perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells is introduced. The inter-connection of independently processed silicon and perovskite subcells is a simple add-on lamination step, alleviating common fabrication complexities of tandem devices. It is demonstrated experimentally and theoretically that PEDOT:PSS is an ideal building block for manipulating the mechanical and electrical functionality of the charge recombination layer by controlling the microstructure on the nano- and mesoscale. It is elucidated that the optimal functionality of the recombination layer relies on a gradient in the d-sorbitol dopant distribution that modulates the orientation of PEDOT across the PEDOT:PSS film. Using this modified PEDOT:PSS composite, a monolithic two-terminal perovskite/silicon tandem solar cell with a steady-state efficiency of 21.0%, a fill factor of 80.4%, and negligible open circuit voltage losses com-pared to single-junction devices is shown. The versatility of this approach is further validated by presenting a laminated two-terminal monolithic perov-skite/organic tandem solar cell with 11.7% power conversion efficiency. It is envisioned that this lamination concept can be applied for the pairing of mul-tiple photovoltaic and other thin film technologies, creating a universal plat-form that facilitates mass production of tandem devices with high efficiency.',\n",

The device area of the perovskite subcell was defined by means of laser patterning of ITO-coated UV-fused silica substrates\\xad. We then devel-oped the ICL on top of the ITO of the silicon cell. Our ICL consists of a thin mesh of nanostructured silver nanowires (AgNW; ≈15 Ω square−1) followed by a blend of highly hole conductive (≈1000 S cm−1) PEDOT:PSS emulsion ink (Cle-vios PH1000; PEDOT :PSS ratio 1:2.5 w/w) with the addi-tion of a significant amount of polyhydric alcohol (40 wt% of d-sorbitol). 40 wt% of d-sorbitol delicately balances the necessary mechanical and rheological properties for our deposition process. Notably, we did not observe a significant viscosity change of the PEDOT:PSS emulsion upon addition of d-sorbitol (from ≈146 to ≈150 mPa s−1). Our ICL composite was deposited through doctor blading and the protocol was modified from previously reported work in our laboratories.[25] Next, we laminated the two subcells to form a monolithic con-nection in series.

The rationale behind this device geometry was to eliminate the performance loss that is commonly observed in connection with micrometer thick TCA composites—usually dominated by a reduced fill factor associated with an increase of the series resistance[22–25]—and thus to engineer perovskite subcell architectures with reduced transport related loss chan-nels. As such, we selected PTAA as a HTL as it allows the highest reported fill factors for perovskite architectures of up to ≈84%.[27–31] Nevertheless, we observed a drop in open-circuit voltage, raising concerns about the homogeneity of the PTAA layer.[27] Additionally, it was revealed that PTAA affords a rather slow extraction of holes when in direct contact with the perov-skite, leading to recombination losses of first and higher order and limited charge collection.[27] To alleviate limited extraction of charge carriers through PTAA only, we further incorpo-rated an ultrathin layer of CuSCN. CuSCN is an intrinsically p-doped high-bandgap semiconductor, with high hole mobility (1.2 × 10−3 cm2 V−1 s−1 vs 1.2 × 10−5 cm2 V−1 s−1 for PTAA[3,32]), good thermal stability, and high transmittance.[33] The latter, along with its ideal refractive index (see Figure 3a), are desir-able attributes for perovskite-preceding layers on tandem applications, as they will allow the transmission of infrared light across the device stack.[3,34–36] The combination of PTAA/ CuSCN increased the fill factor considerably from ≈77% for PTAA alone to >82% on a 10.4 mm2 active area configuration. Current–voltage characterization for both device architectures using PTAA and PTAA/CuSCN is displayed in Figure 3b, and extracted photovoltaic parameters can be found in Table S2 (Supporting Information).',\n",

In one case (3a), the negative charge is, however, delocalized over two SS subunits, although the central unit is more negative. We ration-alize this observation by concluding that the proton of the neutral subunit is weakly bound to both the SS subunits. More specifi-cally, the hydrogen atom forms a weak covalent bond with the neutral PSS subunit (bond length of 1.12 Å) and a strong H-bond with the negative PSS subunit (H-bond length of 1.33 Å).

The analysis of the hydrogen bond interactions in this rendering provides insight into the role of d-sorbitol on the morphology of d-PEDOT:PSS. Figure 4c shows the number of hydrogen bonds formed by sorbitol over time during the MD simulation. As expected, there are almost no hydrogen bonds formed between sorbitol and PEDOT. This is explained by the repulsive poten-tial of PEDOT2+ (Figure 4a (3)), precluding hydrogen atoms to approach. However, a large number of hydrogen bonds are formed between sorbitol and PSS− as well as among sorbitol molecules. As a matter of fact, with up to ≈500 H-bonds for a total of 640 PSS repeat units present in the simulation box, the proportion of hydrogen bonds with sorbitol is about 0.8 per PSS unit. Representative H-bonds for sorbitol–sorbitol and for sorbitol–PSS, along with their respective total electronic den-sity change are rendered in the inset of Figure 4c.

To get a more lucid picture, the distribution function is computed between the closest centers of thiophene rings in different PEDOT chains (i.e., only the shortest distance between two given chains is considered) with and without d-sorbitol, as depicted in the inset of Figure 4d. Both profiles display a maximum at 3.65 Å, a distance close to the experimental π–π stacking distance, as discussed below. Interestingly, the intensity of that peak is more pronounced when 40% sorbitol is mixed with the PEDOT–PSS system, and, thus sorbitol appears to favor the stacking of PEDOT. The peak observed at 7.30 Å corresponds to the formation of the trimer. The intensity is much lower, implying that PEDOT aggre-gates consist of mostly two stacked chains; it is also broader, indi-cating a dispersion of the separation between pairs. This obser-vation is also reflected at the quantum mechanical level and is explained by considering the electrostatic repulsion between the positively charged eight-unit PEDOT chains. We conclude this section by summarizing that the doping mechanism of d-sorbitol is of indirect nature. d-sorbitol does not directly dope PEDOT. Instead, d-sorbitol forms hydrogen bonds with the PSS units, while being repulsed by charged PEDOT units, overall enhancing dimer formation of charged PEDOT oligomers.',\n",

We thus performed resonance statistical Raman spectroscopy (SRS) to assess the electronic struc-ture evolution of PEDOT upon doping.[14,50,51] This can be done by monitoring the symmetric stretching bond Cα Cβ[ O] of the thiophene in PEDOT (Figure 1c). As a result of the disruption of the π-conjugated bond sequence upon doping (see Figure 1c), the main aromatic-symmetric Cα Cβ[ O] stretching mode will undergo two main changes: a frequency shift toward higher wave-numbers and a band splitting.[52] Hence, a ratio between the split quinoid-symmetric Cα Cβ[ O] stretching band and the main aromatic-symmetric Cα Cβ[ O] stretching band is inferred to as a figure of merit for the doping ratio of the PEDOT oligomer.[50–54] We utilized an excitation wavelength of 785 nm to resonantly excite the polaron absorption and maximize the Raman band inten-sity.

       " 'point spectra measured along a surface area of 10 µm2) presented in Figure 5a show clear symmetry alterations in the electronic structure of PEDOT:PSS upon cosolvent-induced doping.[14,51,54] An overview of the observed vibrational modes obtained by spectral deconvolu-tion can be found in Figure S9 and Table S5 (Supporting Infor-mation). Our results show a shift of the main aromatic-symmetric Cα Cβ[ O] (A-band) stretching mode from 1420 to 1429 cm−1 upon the addition of sorbitol and a subsequent increase of the split quinoid-symmetric Cα Cβ[ O] stretching band (Q-band; shoulder in Figure 5a) by a factor of ≈2.6 according to a curve fitting analysis and in agreement with the occurrence of doping. Given the considerations of the MD simulations, both Raman spectroscopy and MD simulations together suggest that addi-tion of sorbitol stimulates segregation of PEDOT from PSS poly-meric sections. Driven by a strong PSS-to-sorbitol H-bonding formation rate, this segregation will translate into PEDOT-rich and PSS-rich domains. While segregating, it is plausible that the overall enhanced molecular alignment will increase the prox-imity between undoped PEDOT and PSS monomeric units. Hence, the ionic interactions between PEDOT and PSS will increase in frequency leading to the observed evolution of the quinoid-doped chemical structure of the PEDOT monomer.',\n",
       " 'Using confocal scanning Raman microscopy, it is possible to gain depth-resolved information on the ratio of the A- and Q- bands and thus draw a profile of the degree of doping across the PEDOT:PSS–sorbitol layer. By gradually moving the focus of the excitation laser throughout the sample, we were able to resolve individual planes at a micrometer level resolution. Figure 5b,c shows depth-resolved mappings of the absolute Raman intensity ratio between the A-band and the Q-band for a TCA and a pristine PEDOT:PSS film, respectively. This rep-resentation clearly unveils a doping gradient toward the film surface, induced by d-sorbitol, in the case of the TCA. Such a gradient is not observed in the case of bare PEDOT:PSS. When implemented in the perovskite/silicon tandem, the top of the TCA will be in direct contact with PEI (perovskite side). We propose that the presence of d-sorbitol at the top promotes the necessary mechanical adhesion for achieving good electrical contact, a requirement toward an effective interconnection layer. We note that the evolution of the overall photovoltaic per-formance shown in Figure 2b is directly linked to the optimiza-tion of the processing of the TCA film, which is detailed in the Supporting Information.',\n",
       " 'To confirm the conformational gradient observed with reso-nance Raman spectroscopy, we analyzed the top and bottom of thin film samples of TCA and PEDOT:PSS using grazing-incidence wide angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS).[55] GIWAXS is particularly suitable because it provides information on the microstructure of thin films with limited scattering depth. The scattering depth at the highest measured outgoing angle was cal-culated to be ≈2.4 and ≈2.2 µm for PEDOT:PSS and TCA, respec-tively. In order to probe the bottom side, prethermally treated films of ≈8 µm thickness were transferred upside down onto single crystalline silicon substrates. Figure 6 (see also Table S6, Sup-porting Information) shows the radial integrated scattered inten-sity signal extracted from GIWAXS scans (Figure S10, Supporting Information) of pristine PEDOT:PSS and d-PEDOT:PSS. As a reference, Figure 6a depicts the characteristic π–π stacking peaks of PSS (Q = 12.3 nm−1) and PEDOT (Q = 17.8 nm−1),[18,19,47,56,57]',\n",

The blue solid line corre-sponds to the experimental value and the orange solid lines correspond to the addition of all the fit peaks. d) Fitted corresponding peaks for π–π PSS (left peak) and π–π PEDOT (right peak) for each sample.

       " 'while Figure 6d compares those signals for d-PEDOT:PSS films probed from the top (Figure 6b) and the bottom (Figure 6c) after Gaussian deconvolution of the scattering signals (see the Supporting Information for details). Importantly, the intensity of both π–π stacking peaks is higher when probed from the top (Figure 6d). The PEDOT π–π stacking intensity is, however, sig-nificantly higher than the PSS π–π stacking intensity. From the MD simulations, we know that d-sorbitol favors the stacking of PEDOT (Figure 4c). There is thus a direct link between the compo-sitional gradient observed with scanning Raman microscopy and the conformational gradient probed with GIWAXS, with accumu-lated d-sorbitol inducing a higher degree of molecular orientation of PEDOT chains (or an increasing number of crystalline aggre-gates) when approaching the top of the TCA film. Conversely,',\n",
       " 'when comparing the PEDOT scattering peak centers of \\xadTCA-top and TCA-bottom, we did not observe any significant change in terms of π-stacking distances or peak width: Q (TCA-bottom) ≈ 1.79 Å−1 (3.51 Å stacking distance) and Q (TCA-top) ≈ 1.80 Å−1 (3.49 Å stacking distance). The latter entails the existence of crys-talline aggregates comparable in size and packing distance across the TCA. Additionally, both TCA-top and TCA\\xad-bottom showed an average ≈30% narrower width, as compared with the pristine PEDOT:PSS, indicating on average a higher degree of PEDOT ordering upon addition of sorbitol.',\n",
       " 'Overall, the implication of a conformational gradient across the TCA film can be ascribed to a macroscopic diffusion of sorbitol toward the top interface. A more doped top–TCA interface is likely to improve mechanical adhesion followed by enhanced physical adsorption, thus, forming an electrical contact with low interconnection losses in laminated hybrid perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells, as demonstrated through a high fill factor and overall high photovoltaic performance.',\n",
       " 'We developed an innovative manufacturing alternative for the fabrication of perovskite/silicon monolithic tandem solar cells based on the lamination of individual subcells. A PEDOT:PSS-assisted transparent-conductive adhesive composite was utilized, for the first time, as interconnection layer, yielding devices with fill factors of up to 80.4% and steady-state efficiencies of up to 21.0%. The fill factor of our monolithic tandem exceeds state-of-the-art technologies based on much more elaborate fabrication protocols. Given the simplicity of our fabrication protocol and the possibility of designing subcells independently, we anticipate that a similar approach could be utilized to realize other hetero-junction tandem structures, for instance, by exploring semi-conductors and semiconducting blends with tunable bandgaps that could be matched with perovskite, silicon, copper indium gallium selenide solar cell (CIGS), and other semiconductors. This versatility was demonstrated here by realizing a perovskite/ organic tandem, in which the organic subcell was deposited using doctor blading on plastic substrates, thus allowing us to showcase and extrapolate potential industrial applications.',\n",
       " 'An important aspect of this work relies in the molecular understanding of the functionality of d-sorbitol-doped PEDOT-PSS. d-sorbitol interacts mainly with PSS via hydrogen bonds to indirectly enhance the orientation of PEDOT chains (conformational doping). This happens predominantly at the top of the d-PEDOT-PSS layer—the junction between both subcells—because d-sorbitol tends to diffuse toward the sur-face to induce π–π stacking of PEDOT. This phenomenon is likely to dominate the necessary mechanical adhesion for good electrical contact.',\n",
       " 'While these results underscore the importance of trans-parent conductive adhesives for the fabrication of photo-voltaic tandem structures, it also paves the way for new science to be explored in connection with the nature of the electrical contact at the interface of the interconnection layer. Specifically, future work will have to provide a fundamental understanding of how molecular interactions at the interface relate to the electronic performance of the interconnection',\n",

The instrument is equipped with a 9.24 keV MetalJet D2 70 kV X-ray source (EXCILLUM, Sweden), a focusing 150 mm Montel optics (INCOATEC, Germany), and a fully evacuated beam path. Three of the available four double slits were used, with the last two double-slit systems being equipped with low scattering silicon slits (JJXray/ SAXSLAB, Denmark). Aperture sizes of the first two beam-shaping double-slit systems were 0.7 × 0.7 and 0.462 × 0.462 mm2, respectively. The last double-slit system was used for absorbing slit scattering and was set to 1.0 × 1.0 mm2. A 2D hybrid-pixel Pilatus 300K detector (Dectris, Switzerland) was used to collect the scattered radiation. The samples were mounted in vacuum on a yz-theta goniometer allowing to adjust grazing incidence angles, which maximizes the scattering volume and thus enhances the scattered intensity. The incidence angle was set to 0.17°, which is in between the critical angles of the PEDOT:PSS layer and the silicon substrates. This angle is used here to enhance the scattered intensity by maximization of the scattering sample volume and minimizing the background scattering from the substrate.
