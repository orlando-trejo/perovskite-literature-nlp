"Although hybrid halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have recently reached record efficiency among thin film photovoltaic technologies, the stability of these devices remains a pressing problem for commercialization. Lamination processes represent an attractive means of fabricating PSCs due to their self-encapsulating nature and compatibility with high-throughput manufacturing methods. These techniques often involve high temperature and pressure, which represents an underexplored region of the perovskite processing parameter space. In this work, we investigate the behavior of the archetypal halide perovskite, methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3), under elevated temperatures and pressures. We also characterize the interactions of MAPbI3 with the commonly used electron and hole transport layers (ETL and HTL) SnO2 and NiOx and find that the latter is particularly susceptible to detrimental interactions at temperatures not far above those commonly used in conventional perovskite film deposition techniques, with deleterious effects on device performance. SnO2 can also evince reactions with the perovskite precursor methylammonium iodide but is more robust than NiOx. Applying the above knowledge, we investigate a laminated bifacial device fabrication strategy that mitigates intrinsic and interface-related threats to the perovskite absorber and report that such devices can reach power conversion efficiencies of >12%. These results not only advance the state of the art in laminated PSCs but also reveal heretofore unknown interactions in commonplace device architectures that should be taken into account when developing device fabrication schemes"
"Standard layer-by-layer solution processing methods constrain lead-halide perovskite device architectures. The layer below the perovskite must be robust to the strong organic solvents used to form the perovskite while the layer above has a limited thermal budget and must be processed in nonpolar solvents to prevent perovskite degradation. To circumvent these limitations, we developed a procedure where two transparent conductive oxide/transport material/perovskite half stacks are independently fabricated and then laminated together at the perovskite/perovskite interface. Using ultraviolet-visible absorption spectroscopy, external quantum efficiency, X-ray diffraction, and time-resolved photoluminesence spectroscopy, we show that this procedure improves photovoltaic properties of the perovskite layer. Applying this procedure, semitransparent devices employing two high-temperature oxide transport layers were fabricated, which realized an average efficiency of 9.6% (maximum: 10.6%) despite series resistance limitations from the substrate design. Overall, the developed lamination procedure curtails processing constraints, enables new device designs, and affords new opportunities for optimization."
"A multipurpose interconnection layer based on poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) doped with poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS), and d-sorbitol for monolithic perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells is introduced. The interconnection of independently processed silicon and perovskite subcells is a simple add-on lamination step, alleviating common fabrication complexities of tandem devices. It is demonstrated experimentally and theoretically that PEDOT:PSS is an ideal building block for manipulating the mechanical and electrical functionality of the charge recombination layer by controlling the microstructure on the nano- and mesoscale. It is elucidated that the optimal functionality of the recombination layer relies on a gradient in the d-sorbitol dopant distribution that modulates the orientation of PEDOT across the PEDOT:PSS film. Using this modified PEDOT:PSS composite, a monolithic two-terminal perovskite/silicon tandem solar cell with a steady-state efficiency of 21.0%, a fill factor of 80.4%, and negligible open circuit voltage losses compared to single-junction devices is shown. The versatility of this approach is further validated by presenting a laminated two-terminal monolithic perovskite/organic tandem solar cell with 11.7% power conversion efficiency. It is envisioned that this lamination concept can be applied for the pairing of multiple photovoltaic and other thin film technologies, creating a universal platform that facilitates mass production of tandem devices with high efficiency."
"Optoelectronic devices based on metal halide perovskites, including solar cells and light-emitting diodes, have attracted tremendous research attention globally in the last decade. Due to their potential to achieve high carrier mobilities, organic–inorganic hybrid perovskite materials can enable high-performance, solution-processed field-effect transistors (FETs) for next-generation, low-cost, flexible electronic circuits and displays. However, the performance of perovskite FETs is hampered predominantly by device instabilities, whose origin remains poorly understood. Here, perovskite single-crystal FETs based on methylammonium lead bromide are studied and device instabilities due to electrochemical reactions at the interface between the perovskite and gold source–drain top contacts are investigated. Despite forming the contacts by a gentle, soft lamination method, evidence is found that even at such “ideal” interfaces, a defective, intermixed layer is formed at the interface upon biasing of the device. Using a bottom-contact, bottom-gate architecture, it is shown that it is possible to minimize such a reaction through a chemical modification of the electrodes, and this enables fabrication of perovskite single-crystal FETs with high mobility of up to ≈15 cm2 V_1 s_1 at 80 K. This work addresses one of the key challenges toward the realization of high-performance solution-processed perovskite FETs."
"From a base material of conductive polymer (poly-(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate), PEDOT:PSS), a flexible and high-conductivity (as low as 45 Ω/sq) transparent electrode was fabricated on polydimethylsiloxane elastomer by an acid treatment and transfer process. Combined with the D-sorbitol-doped PEDOT:PSS electric glue, we successfully demonstrated a vacuum-free and ambient lamination fabrication process for semi-transparent perovskite solar cells using triple cation Cs005(MA017FA083)095Pb(I083Br017)3 perovskite. By this manufacturing-friendly lamination process, we fabricated semi-transparent perovskite solar cell devices with power conversion efficiencies up to 16.4% and variable transparencies."
"Metal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have undergone remarkably rapid progress with their power conversion efficiency (PCE) increasing from 3.8% to 23.7% in merely 9 years. Although an enormous research effort has been devoted to performance improvement, there has been little investigation of the effect of postfabrication processes such as encapsulation or packaging on device PCE. In this work, the effect of pressing on the performance of mesoporous PSCs is studied. Cells with the state-of-the-art architecture glass/FTO/c-TiO2/mp-TiO2/perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD/gold are used in this study. It is found that pressing under the condition typically used for encapsulation is beneficial for these PSCs, improving their PCE consistently by more than 7% relative on average. The effect of pressing was characterized by light current density-voltage measurement (LJV) time-resolved photoluminescence (TR-PL), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS). The PCE enhancement is due to an improved interface resulting in a higher fill factor, lower recombination, and lower hysteresis. It is found that pressing pressure of 400-500 mbar is appropriate; higher pressure at 1000 mbar is detrimental. Moreover, pressure must be maintained to maintain the PCE improvement. Pressing is an essential part of an encapsulation process, and this work demonstrates the beneficial effect of pressing on PSCs, inspiring future development of encapsulation and packaging."
"The rapid progress in the field of perovskite solar cells has led to efficiencies approaching that of crystalline silicon in single junction devices, and increasing emphasis is now being placed on scalable fabrication strategies that have the potential to truly impact the photovoltaics industry. The standard fabrication route of sequential, layer-bylayer depositions to form the device stack is limited by the small range of selective materials that can withstand successive solvent exposures and thermal annealings. In order to overcome this limitation, we have developed a method to fabricate the device stacks through mechanical lamination under moderate pressures and temperatures. The procedure involves fabricating two transparent conductive oxide/transport material/perovskite half stacks and laminating them together at the perovskite/perovskite interface. This procedure previously achieved 10% efficiency in initial attempts based on methyl ammonium lead iodide (MAPI) perovskite compositions. Herein, we reported the fabrication conditions to achieve a reproducible lamination with a complex, multi-cation perovskite, [Cs0.05(MA0.17F A0.83)0.95P b(I0.83Br0.17)3] (FAMACs), laminated at 18°C and with a pressure of 350 psi for 30 minutes. The resulting material showed a sharpening of the optical absorption edge and a slight reduction in the band gap from 1.622 eV to 1.616 eV, indicative of improved ordering and reduced defects. Concurrently, time resolved photoluminescence measurements revealed an increased luminescence lifetime from 85 ns to 123 ns."
